        <h1>Responsive design</h1>
        <p>
            Responsive design describes an approach to web design, 
            used to create a layout adjusting to various windows and screen sizes with regards to screen width, 
            resolutions etc. for best user experience. 
            The web pages are adapted to avoid for example zooming or overly long line lengths depending on if you are on a desktop, laptop, or smart phone. 
        
            <br><br>Responsive design is normally done using the principle “mobile first” – 
            i.e. the experience is defined on mobile platforms such as smartphones and tablets and then scaled up to larger screens.
        
            Important to note is that it is not a separate technology but a set of practices in HTML and CSS that allows web pages to alter their layout and appearance to suit different screens.
